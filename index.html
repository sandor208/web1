    <h2>L2L</h2>
  <p>In mid 2018, the SPN function was integrated into the KR BD from KR PM by transferring the one L5 HC (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-gilsoo-jung-77b69249/" target="_blamk" title="linkedin">Gilsoo Jung</a>).  Since the integration of SPN function into KR BD, we quickly began to widen the horizon of the SPN domain and increase the number of
  service providers in ea ch domain in order to 1) Tackle the diversified needs and pain-points of <strong> <u>Brand Owners/Manufacturer</u> Sellers</strong>, 2) Capture the qualified/cross border-relevant leads through their own networks and 3) Reduce the reliance on a few dominant service providers.  As of Q3 2019, with 1 SPN dedicated HC, we developed 57 service providers (+47 to 2018) across 10 domains (+8 to 2018 / Logistics, Payment, Marketing, Education, Sales Agency, Certification, Customs, Tax, Finance etc.), generating 1,437 leads, 99 launches and $ 5,346K GMS.  In Q4 2019, to accelerate this momentum and develop KR SPN on a deeper level, we repurposed our resources from 2 Government/Industry Association/Online Seller Community BDMs & 1 SPN BDM to 3 Government/Industry Association/Online Seller Community/SPN BDMs.  Also, we classified the current SPNs into 3 tier groups based on 1) Service Quality (50%), 2) Lead Generation Capability (40%), and 3) Sponsorship Record (10%) in order to provide Sellers with the high-quality service providers that meet their needs and prioritize each BD manager’s resources (See Appendix 1. 2020 SPN Tier).</p>

  <p style="margin-top:45px;">In 2020, to accelerate the growth momentum of SPN among all lead sources, (See Appendix 1. 2019 Full Year L2L (Lead to Launch) (See Appendix 2. 2019 Full Year L2L Analysis), we will unfold ‘Double, Triple Project’, aiming to Double the number of Service Providers(57 to 115, +101.8% YoY), NSR Leads(1,437 to 2,880, +100.42% YoY), the number of Launch(99 to 247, +149.4% YoY) and Triple the volume of total US DSR GMS($ 1,704K to $ 5,346K, +213.57% YoY) (See Appendix 3. 2020 SPN Target).  Out of total 10 SPN domains, our primary focus will be shipping, education, sales agency, and marketing, in which we see huge business impact in terms of NSR lead generation and SPN’s product services that help our business teams drive the new category development. Aside from each BD manager’s tailored efforts to develop the assigned SPNs, we’ll actively leverage a variety of vehicles such as SPN Conference, ESP Summit, Monthly SPN Promotion, and Seller Conference Sponsorship to acquire and nurture our service providers in a scalable manner.  </p>
