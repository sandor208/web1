    <h2>Initiative</h2>
  <p>KR>US has well-developed logistics with plenty of express couriers, forwarders and logistics companies.  In early stage, KR>US shipping was led by the forwarders with Amazon selling experiences.  The conventional express courier and logistics firm entered with ecommerce-dedicated team.  With the years of service level improvement, FBA delivery process settled. In 2019, US FBA active rate runs to 65.8%.  KR>JP shipping leans to MFN service due to comply with customs and compliance issue.  Since two countries are geographically close, Sellers can offer similar MFN delivery time and price with the FBA service. (KR>JP FBA active 36.5% in 2019)  We have three shipping providers who can serve customs clearance of limited category with high price and complicating process.  KR>EU shipping has been less prioritized since Sellers should mitigate VAT hurdle beforehand.  We have two express couriers and one forwarder for this arc, but they are passive about jumping into EU shipping with the stagnant KR>EU FBA shipping volume due to the difficulty in acquiring UK VAT.  </p>
