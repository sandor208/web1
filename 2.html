    <h2>Plan</h2>
  <p>One weakness of this domain is lack of e-commerce experienced shipping providers.  Compare to other domains, a handful number of shipping server providers exist in our pool, but majority of providers (54.6%, 12 shipping service providers) are B2B-blooded, which cannot operate Amazon shipping service due to low understanding of Amazon global selling, and lack of e-commerce Seller experience. In addition, KR>JP and KR>EU Sellers have challenges in finding a shipping provider with high quality agency for custom clearance, ACP (Attorney for Customs Procedure) or IOR (Importer of Records), and UK VAT.  Although there are three KR>JP one-stop-solution shipping providers but each provider handles limited product category with high cost, long lead time, and complicating process.  Also, KR>EU Sellers face difficulty acquiring UK VAT through sole VAT solution providers.   </p>
